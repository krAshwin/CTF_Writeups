**Day 1**
APKs are nothing but zip file and we can extract them, it gives us different files but I have no ideas as of now, what they are!!!!!

**Day 2**
classes.dex seem interesting as it contains data for different classes in the android application, but can't read it! :sad: Seems like binary files. There must be someway to read those files.

**Day 3**
The `jar` file I got from the classes.dex can also be unzipped. Noice! It gives some directory worth looking into. `com` looked interesting.

**Day 4**
WHat am I going to do with all these classes???? And that too unreadable...aaah...this is frustrating.

**Day 5**
`MainActivity.class` is the one where we put all our code right? Yes we do! But how to read that??

**Day 6**
[Abdul](github.com/KnightTuring) said something about `jad`. Hmm I need to have a look!! He said it will help me with convert class files to readable format/java code!

**Day 7**
The application I am testing is sending some kind of GET request to a web address but I can't find the parameter to which it is sending the request :sad:

**Day 8** 
Yayay!! I got something interesting....woooohoooo!! I AM A L33T H4XOR!!

**Day 9**
I asked [Jatin](github.com/jatinmakhijanitr) to make a Flutter app, to show him, I can hack it. :cry: Someone help me out. I can't. Got to start all over again.

Bye. Not documenting anymore.
